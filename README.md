# UCEFCommonFederate
A code repository for UCEF Common Federate concept and use cases.
The use of distributed simulation/co-simulation is one method to analyze the system behavior and performance. This project describes core requirements that necessitate the use of multiple HLA federations and provide use cases to demonstrate various mechanisms for constructinig an integrated HLA federations. 
This repository ccontains:
    * Item 1 An Airport usecase construced as a single federation including seven federates (ATC, AirportCoordinator, AirlineGateManager1&2, PassengerManager1&2, PeopleFlow)
    * Item 2
